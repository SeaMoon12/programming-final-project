        ======== TRAGEDY AT BLACKWOOD MANOR: LORD ALISTAIR FOUND DEAD ========
          POLICE PROBE "CRIME OF PASSION" IN LOCKED-ROOM MYSTERY
          By Julian Vane, Investigative Reporter
        
            BLACKWOOD ESTATE –  The  prestigious  Blackwood  family  has  been
            thrust  into   a   "living   nightmare"  following   the  gruesome
            discovery of Lord Alistair Blackwood (72)  early  Monday  morning.
            The patriarch, a man known for his iron-fisted  control  over  the
            local shipping industry, was found deceased in his  private  study
            at approximately 6:00 AM.

            A Gruesome Discovery
                The body was discovered by  the  estate’s  long-serving  maid,
                Martha Higgins, when she arrived to deliver the Lord’s morning
                tea. According to police reports, the study  door  was  locked
                from the  inside.  Investigators  state  that  Lord  Blackwood
                succumbed to a single, fatal puncture wound to  the  neck. The
                weapon-believed to be a silver letter opener  from the  Lord’s
                own  desk-remains  missing.  Detective  Inspector  Graves  has
                characterized the slaying as a "crime of passion," citing  the
                intimate nature of the attack.

            The Inner Circle Under Fire
                As the investigation unfolds, the movements of  those  closest
                to the Lord have come under intense scrutiny:

                    - Arthur Blackwood (Son): The  heir  apparent  provided  a
                      confirmed alibi at the Royal  Casino. However, witnesses
                      noted Arthur stepped out for "an hour  of air"  at  3:00
                      AM-the estimated time of the struggle.

                    - Lady Elara Blackwood (Wife): Lady  Elara  maintains  she
                      was asleep in her separate wing of the  manor.  With  no
                      witnesses to  verify  her  whereabouts,  she  remains  a
                      person of interest.

                    - Lily  Blackwood  (Granddaughter):  The  10-year-old  was
                      present in the house, but  authorities  have  officially
                      ruled her out. "A child of  her  stature  is  physically
                      incapable of such a calculated  strike,"  Graves  noted.
            
            CASE CLOSED: NO JUSTICE FOR ALISTAIR
                [UPDATE: Nov 12, 2010] In a shocking turn of events, the Crown
                Prosecution  Service  has  announced  the  suspension  of  the
                Blackwood investigation. Despite the missing  weapon  and  the
                gaps in the family's alibis, officials cited a "total lack  of
                forensic evidence" to move forward. The Blackwood fortune  now
                hangs in limbo, as the family prepares  for  a  lengthy  legal
                battle over the estate-a shadow that will loom over the  manor
                until a new owner dares to claim it.
